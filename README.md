# Data science projects

In this repository I am going to share with you 7 exploratory data analysis projects for beginners that will help master numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013. Now each product has certain attributes that set it apart from other products. The same is the case with each store. The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision-makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.

Who doesnâ€™t like Netflix? This dataset on Kaggle has TV shows and movies available on Netflix. One can create a good quality Exploratory Data Analysis project using this dataset. Using this dataset, one can find out: what type of content is produced in which country, identify similar content from the description, and many more interesting tasks. So in this project, I am doing exploratory data analysis (data cleaning, data processing, data visualizations) on this dataset.

Who doesn't play fifa all the time? In this project we are analyzing the fifa dataset to understand the distribution of the different players and all the hidden relationships between the fifa statistics.
